 <p>Consumer Demographic Analytics using the "Heroes of Pymoli" dataset.</p>
  

<p> The <b>objective</b> of this excerise was to practice using the Pandas library for Data Analysis. Starting with a dataset, we first determine the integrity of the dataset by reviewing the data for duplicates, non-unique product id values or incomplete categories. Then, the second step, was to automate the process of summarizing per categorical data and using aggregation functions to produce results based on a given metric. The final results were presented in Pandas's Dataframe, which were ready to be exported into excel for the end-user. Once the final reporting was complete, a written summary of conclusions was also provided in the jupyter notebook for review.<p>
